## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Project Overview
- Cleaned and prepared customer transaction data
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify spending patterns
- Engineered features such as age groups and time-based variables
- Built a linear regression model to predict customer spending

## Key Insights
- Customers aged 26–45 spend more on average
- Referral-based customers tend to spend more
- Certain states contribute significantly to total revenue
- Spending shows seasonal trends

## Files
- `notebook/` – Jupyter notebook with full analysis
